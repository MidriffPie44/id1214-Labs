This task was done by Isak Nyberg and Rahul Sharma Kothuri.The task that we made was to classify houses based on the number of bathrooms that they have. we used data from  https://www.kaggle.com/shree1992/housedata. Each data point had 7 features: the house price, the number of bedrooms, the number of sqft of living space, the number of sqft of lot, the number of floors, the house condition rated on a scale of one to five and lastly, the year the house was built. In the end, the model was able to label between 65% and 70% of the houses correctly. This makes me think it ran quite successfully since that is a lot better than guessing by chance. What makes us think that it is not higher is that the correlation of the given features to the number of bathrooms is not that strong as some houses with the same overall size may still have a different number of bathrooms by design.
